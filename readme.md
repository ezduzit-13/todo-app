# My Todo App
Here I made a simple app that does all of your basic CRUDing and now much else. Oh I guess it can actually authenticate you too! But yeah, it pretty much only allows you to write text and add it to this long list specific to the user. After the user adds text to this thing, he will then also have the ability to update what he wrote, and delete what he wrote. 
## How to start the project
The project is a REACT frontend and a DJANGO backend. I use the Django Rest Framework in order to build the api that my frontend will use to add things to the list, delete things, and update things and so on and so forth. 

If you would like to run the app.. you only need to follow a few simple steps. 
1. Install the requirement .txt with the command
 `pip install requirements.txt`

2. Next you will need to go into the react-frontend folder and run the command `npm install`

3. After that you should be good to run the command
`python manage.py runserver`

Then you are set enjoy deleting stuff and all that.
